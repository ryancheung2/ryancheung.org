        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Our company strives to create a better writing experience through the use of sustainable erasers, 
            whilst reducing carbon emissions and food waste. We plan to recycle fruit peels and produce effective 
            erasers with them. We hope that our little change can spark a big difference in the world.
